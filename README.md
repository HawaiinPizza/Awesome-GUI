# Ross-Good-GUI
To quote Ross, "None of this would be possible without multiple mathematicians and scientists, working around the clock to break reality"

The main goal of this project is to create the perfect GUI. So far, I want to create 3 programs that I think are important:

- Program Menu: Able to launch programs/commands from a menu. It doesn't have to be a menu, but it could be a radian, or a cross.
	- Openbox menu: I like this, sense I can have nested programs
	- Dmenu: type out some text and get a program. Extremely useful for scripting.
	- Xmonad's grid launcher: I enjoy this so much. http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Actions-GridSelect.html. I just select what I want from the keyboard, and don't even have to type it out
	- Radian mouse: https://lifehacker.com/radian-is-a-radial-mouse-centered-application-launcher-5597469 or something similar.

- Mouse/Keyboard Gestures: I like this idea, but I think being pure mouse is a bad idea. So, I want to be able to integrate keyboard. Think of a program like `sxhkd`, but instead of binding keyboards and mouse separately, we bind them together.

In terms of the MUST HAVE FEATURES, I can think of three. Feel free to add more

- Conditional status: What I mean, is if you're playing *DOOM*, or working with *Photoshop*, you should be able to unbind your keys. So maybe you binded *CTRL-Click* to do something, but in those programs, you don't want that. So, I want to disable it. Not only that, but I want other conditionals, but those I can't really think of.
- Profiles: This is an extension of the previous point, but I want there to be different profiles. The mouse radian idea for example: if you have 50+ programs, than you'll have to comprise with laziness over efficiently.
